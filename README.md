# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ SemUN repository

Repository for SemUN project. It is composed of a docker-compose stack, with:

- An API ([`un-semun-api`](un-semun-api))
- A frontend ([`un-semun-front`](un-semun-front))
- An NLP pipeline ([`un-ml-pipeline`](un-semun-db)).
- A Neo4j graph database (`neo4j` service in [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml))
- Scripts to populate the database ([`un-semun-misc`](un-semun-misc))
- A scraper for the United Nations Digital Library

### Running the project

#### Install requirements

You also need to have Docker installed, I'm using [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) as a Docker desktop client for macOS, but regular Docker installation works perfectly fine as well.

#### Run the project

When Docker is setup, you just have to run:

```bash
# Start the containers
docker-compose up -d
```

Open the frontend at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080) if using Docker Desktop or [http://un-semun-frontend.un-semun.orb.local/](http://un-semun-frontend.un-semun.orb.local/) if using OrbStack.

#### Stop the stack

To stop the stack, just run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

You are all set! ðŸŽ‰

### Ingest documents using the ML pipeline API

To ingest documents, you can use the ML pipeline API. You can find more information about it in the [`README.md`](un-ml-pipeline/README.md) of the `un-ml-pipeline` folder.

You basically need to send a `POST` request to the `/run` endpoint at URL `http://un-semun-api.un-semun.orb.local` with a JSON body containing the following fields:

```json
[
    {"recordId": "<record_id_0>"},
    {"recordId": "<record_id_1>"},
    {"recordId": "<record_id_2>"},
    ...
]
```

You can also send a `POST` request to the `/run_search` endpoint, at the same URL, with a natural language query to the UN Digital Library. The API will then scrape the results and ingest them in the database.

```json
{
  "q": "<query>"
}
```

You can also include a limit number of results to scrape, by adding a field `"n": <value>` in the payload.

For instance:

```json
{
  "q": "Women in peacekeeping",
  "n": 256
}
```
